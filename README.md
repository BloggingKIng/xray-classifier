<h2> Installing the Model </h2>
<p> The trained model was too big to be uploaded on Github. So, I decided to upload in on Google Drive from where you can acccess it </p>
<p> In future when the new/updated models will be trained, the link to them will be included in this file along with the instructions on how to use it </p>
<hr>
<p> So first of all download the model from  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KBKUyLmSb7fHo5_uhpFZvi9661hEF4f8/view?usp=sharing"> this link </a></p>
<p> After downloading the <code>LossOptimized.zip</code> file extrat its content to <code>Classifier\trained_models</code> in the project's directory.</p>
<p> Your model should now be available at the following location </p>
<code> xray-classifier\Classifier\trained_models\LossOptimized </code>

<b>Don't rename the <code> LossOptimized </code> to anything else otherwise the webapp will give errors!</b>
